"""
Explanation:

Our model consist of 2 LSTM cells that read the sequence in opposite directions.
The input is a sequence of 128 dimensional vectors each containing character information corresponding to one frame of the sliding window.
E.g. an image of size 32x(32+ 2*stepsize) is converted to [[...], [...], [...]] by the cnn, where [...] is a vector of
128 values describing the respective frame.

The outputs of the 2 LSTM cells are then combined (via average?) to a vector of probability-vectors p_i.
Each probability-vector contains 128 probabilities for a given character.
Due to the unsegmented nature of the word image at the character level, the length of the LSTM outputs is not consistent with the length of a target word string.
We therefore apply the CTC approach to make reasonable character sequences out of the probability-vector (see https://www.tensorflow.org/versions/r0.12/api_docs/python/nn/connectionist_temporal_classification__ctc_)

The output of the CTC is then returned

TODOs:

- where do the probability vectors come from?
- implement CTC
